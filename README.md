This repo contains the code referenced in the post below, a quick walkthrough of StepZen's new GraphQL Studio tool:

- **[Behind the Music (in 2 Sentences or Less)](https://stepzen.com/blog/new-workflowf-for-api-mash-ups-postman-stepzen-youtube-data-api): Mashing up the Spotify & Knowledge Graph APIs**


  > And with that, our Spotify track query now returns Knowledge-annotated data, with short (and shorter) descriptive summaries of a track, the album it came from, and its recording artist:

- **[Spotify OAuth 2.0 Tokens (in 3 Steps Total)](././getauth.md): Easily bundle an Access Token request with StepZen's @sequence directive**


  > Where @materializer allows us to step through our API requests in implicit order, simply by descending through our type fields and back-filling secondary data, @sequence lets us step through API requests in explicit order.
